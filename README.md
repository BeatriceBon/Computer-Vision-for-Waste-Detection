# Computer-Vision-for-Waste-Detection
This is the final project for the "Vision,Robotics,and Planningâ€”Intelligent Machines" course taken at Boston University.  

It explores the application of powerful Deep Learning techniques in addressing the urgent problem of waste management. Utilizing the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model, this study demonstrates how computer vision can be leveraged to identify and classify various types of waste, improving the efficiency of recycling processes. Through the training of a neural network model on the TACO dataset, which includes a diversified range of waste images, my work highlights the potential of integrating these types of trained models into robotic systems, creating the possibility to automate the waste sorting process effectively. These results show promising directions for real-time waste detection, suggesting significant potentials for sustainable waste management practices globally. The findings call for the continued development of more balanced and richer datasets, and integrated robotic systems to further improve the accuracy and applicability of waste detection technologies.
